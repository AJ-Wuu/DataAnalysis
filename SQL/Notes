A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.
DBMS = Database Management System
    1. Relational (RDBMS): store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
                   SQL -- Structured Query Language
    2. Non-SQL: no tables or relationships, don't understand SQL

SELECT * -- select all
