%{
  After downloading a package from an external source (eg. mathwork.com), unpack the package.
  If we'd like to use the function in the package with an existing Matlab file, we should put all the unpacked package in the target file's directory.
  If we simply want to use the function itself: type cd("XXX") in the command window 
                                                to change directory to the directory of the function and the function is ready to be go.
