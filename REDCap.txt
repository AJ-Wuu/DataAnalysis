Terms ***************************************************************************************
Cross sectional study design -> data that is collected once per person
Repeat measures study design -> any data collected more than once for a single person,
                                often when collecting data on a participant over time but not necessarily
Longitudinal study design -> specific type of repeated measures study where data is collected numerous times for one participant over time
Data structure / format -> how the rows and columns of the data set are organized to handle the study design
                           including: 1. simple data structure -> 1 row/person, 1 column/outcome
                                                               -> basic and simplest structure, suited for cross sectional design studies
                                      2. wide format -> 1 row/person, repeat columns used to handle the repeat measures over time
                                                     Pros: can work well with certain study designs
                                                           -> pre-post -> 1 measure before and after intervention
                                                           -> repeatability of measure -> compare one method of measuring RBC to another
                                                     Cons: a. time is not in its own discrete column
                                                           b. outcomes live in numerous columns, hard to summarize
                                                           c. gets clunky with many outcomes over many events, 
                                                              as we need to generate a new variable/column each time we have a new event (slow!)
                                      3. long format -> numerous rows/person, 1 column/outcome
                                                     Pros: a. time/encounter is a discrete variable in its own column
                                                           b. outcomes live in one column instead of numerous
                                                           c. shares the same underlying concept that is used to hold data in medical record systems
                                                           d. adds another visit for the same person only requires the addition of one new row of data, 
                                                              rather than many new columns (wide format)
                                                           e. fast and flexible
                                                           f. gold standard for data collection 
                                                              (eg. scheduling module requires longitudinal, more complicated survey designs are easier)

Survey Design ***************************************************************************************
1. Build a new project
2. Enable the "Use surveys in this project" in the "Main project settings"
3. Use the "Online Designer" in the "Design your data collection instruments & enable your surveys"
   3.1. Click the "Enable" button on the default instrument
   3.2. New functions -> Survey Expiration time (optional) &  Redirect to a URL (allows you to specify the URL you'd like the users be taken to after finishing the survey)
4. Save and if it needs further change, use the "Survey settings" button on the "Online Designer" tab
5. If needed, change the "Survey status" part in the "Survey settings" between "Survey active" and "Survey offline"
6. Click the survey name to add questions
7. Use the "Manage Survey Participants" on the left column and the "Open public survey" to preview the survey (not for collecting data)
