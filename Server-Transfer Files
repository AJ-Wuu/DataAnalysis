1. winSCP -> https://winscp.net/eng/index.php
2. scp.exe command from the command prompt
   For example: if you have a lot of files ending in .dat you could do
                scp  ajwuu@its-og-login1.XXX.edu:*.dat .
                to transfer them all to your local computer.
                Or to go the other way you could send all your .m files with
                scp *.m ajwuu@its-og-login1.XXX.edu:
3. (RECOMMENDED) use MobaXterm_Personal instead of PuTTy -> MobaXterm has a much better interactive platform with upload, download, etc.
